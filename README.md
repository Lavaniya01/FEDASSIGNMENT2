# FEDASSIGNMENT2

This website allows users to earn points each time they engage with the platform, such as posting advertisements or utilizing various services. The number of points granted is contingent on the specific activity, with services offering higher point rewards compared to posting advertisements. The reward system is structured into three distinct categories: bronze, silver, and gold. Users ascend through these tiers based on the cumulative points they accumulate. For instance, reaching 100 points elevates a user to the bronze tier, 200 points to silver, and 300 points to gold. Once a user attains a specific tier, they retain that status even if their points temporarily dip below the threshold due to activities like redeeming vouchers. This ensures that users enjoy the benefits associated with their highest achieved tier and are not penalized for utilizing their accrued points. The points can be redeemed for various things like getting free delivery.
